# Treasure-Hunt	
Graph that consisted of nodes, representing cities, and both an ID, that checked if the treasure was reachable from another city, and a Boolean value that indicated if treasure was located or not.  Using Depth First Search traversing technique, I traversed different maps, based on user choice, to determine if a treasure was found.  Using a stack as a container, the program is easily able to check each location on the map.  Some maps may have multiple treasures, or ways of getting to a treasure.  I tested various inputs, along with inputs that would not be allowed, on this program.  After the user indicates which map they would like checked, the program creates objects, that represent different map locations, along with IDâ€™s and true and false values for that specific map.  Unfortunately, the method I chose was not particularly unique, even though I believed it would be when starting this program.  Maps and keys are used for hashing methods, meaning my map was just slightly askew from that.
